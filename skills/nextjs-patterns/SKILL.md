# Next.js Patterns

Next.js blurs the line between server and client. The App Router defaults to Server Components -- code runs on the server unless you opt into the client. Understand the boundary and you control performance.

## App Router Fundamentals

- **`app/` directory** uses file-system routing. `page.tsx` renders a route, `layout.tsx` wraps children, `loading.tsx` provides Suspense fallbacks.
- **Server Components by default.** Add `'use client'` only when you need browser APIs, state, or event handlers.
- **Push `'use client'` as low as possible.** Keep parent layouts as Server Components; wrap only the interactive leaf.

## Server Components vs Client Components

| Aspect | Server Component | Client Component |
|---|---|---|
| Runs on | Server only | Server (SSR) + Client (hydration) |
| Can use | `async/await`, DB access, fs | `useState`, `useEffect`, event handlers |
| Bundle impact | Zero JS sent to client | Included in client bundle |
| Data fetching | `fetch()` or direct DB calls | SWR, React Query, or Server Actions |

## Server Actions

- Define with `'use server'` directive at the top of a function or file.
- Use for form submissions, mutations, and revalidation -- replaces API routes for many use cases.
- Call `revalidatePath()` or `revalidateTag()` after mutations to refresh cached data.
- Validate inputs with Zod on the server side -- never trust client data.

## Data Fetching & Caching

- **`fetch()` in Server Components** is extended with caching: `fetch(url, { next: { revalidate: 60 } })`.
- **Static by default.** Pages are statically rendered unless they use dynamic functions (`cookies()`, `headers()`, `searchParams`).
- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):** set `revalidate` in `fetch` or at the page/layout level to rebuild pages in the background.
- **`unstable_cache`** for caching non-fetch data (DB queries, computations) with tags.

## Middleware

- `middleware.ts` at the project root runs on every request before routing.
- Use for auth redirects, geolocation, A/B testing, and header manipulation.
- **Keep middleware lightweight** -- it runs on the Edge Runtime with limited APIs (no Node.js `fs`, `path`, etc.).

## Route Organization

- **Route groups** `(name)` organize code without affecting URLs.
- **Parallel routes** `@slot` and **intercepting routes** `(.)` for modals and complex layouts.
- **API routes** via `route.ts` for webhooks and external integrations.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Adding `'use client'` to entire pages | Move interactivity to leaf components; keep page as Server Component |
| Fetching in Client Components when Server Components suffice | Fetch on the server, pass data as props |
| Missing `loading.tsx` causing layout shifts | Add `loading.tsx` or `<Suspense>` boundaries for async content |
| Not revalidating after Server Action mutations | Call `revalidatePath()` or `revalidateTag()` post-mutation |
| Large client bundles from barrel exports | Import directly from module paths, not `index.ts` |
